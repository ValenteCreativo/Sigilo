 * @title EVVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine Virtualization) Core Contract
 * @author Mate labs
 * @notice Core payment processing and token management system for the EVVM ecosystem
 * @dev This contract serves as the central hub for:
 *      - Multi-token payment processing with signature verification
 *      - Staker reward distribution and incentive mechanisms
 *      - Cross-chain bridge functionality (Fisher Bridge)
 *      - Balance management across the EVVM ecosystem
 *      - Integration with NameService for identity-based payments
 *      - Treasury integration for privileged balance operations
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Synchronous and asynchronous payment processing with nonce management
 * - Staker privilege system with enhanced rewards and transaction processing benefits
 * - Multi-recipient payment batching (payMultiple, dispersePay)
 * - Administrative payment distribution (caPay, disperseCaPay)
 * - Proxy pattern support with delegatecall fallback for upgradeability
 * - Cross-chain asset bridging capabilities through Fisher Bridge
 * - Deflationary tokenomics with era-based reward halving mechanism
 * - Treasury-controlled balance management for minting and burning operations
 * 
 * Payment Types:
 * - `payNoStaker_*`: Standard payments for non-stakers with basic functionality
 * - `payStaker_*`: Enhanced payments for Principal Token stakers with priority fee rewards
 * - `payMultiple`: Batch payments to multiple recipients with individual success tracking
 * - `dispersePay`: Single-source multi-recipient distribution with signature verification
 * - `caPay`: Administrative token distribution for smart contracts
 * - Treasury functions: Direct balance manipulation for authorized operations
 * 
 * Economic Model:
 * - Principal Token as principal token with reward distribution system
 * - Era-based reward halving when supply thresholds are reached
 * - Staker incentives through transaction processing rewards
 * - Random bonus rewards for triggering era transitions
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Signature-based transaction authorization with EIP-191 compliance
 * - Dual nonce system: synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous (custom)
 * - Executor validation for delegated transaction processing
 * - Balance verification before transfers to prevent overdrafts
 * - Time-delayed governance for critical upgrades (30-day implementation, 1-day admin)
 * - Access control through admin and treasury authorization
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - NameService: Identity resolution for username-based payments
 * - Staking Contract: Staker status management and reward distribution
 * - Treasury Contract: Privileged balance operations and token management
 * - Implementation Contract: Proxy pattern for contract upgradeability
 * 
 * @custom:version 1.0.0
 * @custom:testnet This contract is deployed on testnet for development and testing
 * @custom:security Time-delayed governance, signature verification, access control
 * @custom:upgrade-pattern Transparent proxy with admin-controlled implementation
